<img title="BrainHack 2024 logo" src="/fig/brainhack.png">

**Have you ever wanted, but lacked the time, to learn Python programming** to update your data analyses and perhaps enhance them with new tools? In this era where open science is increasingly promoted, we are offering you the opportunity, over the course of two days, to delve into Python and its free tools.The idea behind this project is primarily collaborative; we aim to share our programming expertise to support you in what can sometimes be a long and challenging learning process.

# Obectives
The objective is simple: by the end of these two days, we hope to provide you with a better understanding of Python’s role and value, help you begin transitioning some of your scripts and analysis methods, and offer suggestions to improve your workflows.

## Requierements
For this project, no prerequisites or prior documentation are required. We will provide you with an interface and a ready-to-use environment so you can start programming, even from scratch.
We look forward to seeing you motivated and eager to join this project. If you have any datasets you'd like to work on, feel free to bring them along, and we’ll be here to guide you. Get ready for coding!
